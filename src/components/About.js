        <h1>What I Want To Learn</h1>
          <p>I joke that I want to know <i>all</i> the things. Okay, it's not
          really a joke, but I'll break down the big topics I'd like to dive
          into:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>GraphQL</li>
            <li>More Python! Specifically, Python 3</li>
            <li>This list could go on forever, but know that I am endlessly
            curious!</li>
          </ul>
        <h1>A Little About Who I Am</h1>
        <p>I've dabbled in a lot of things trying to find my place in the
        world. I got a degree in political science, I tried my hand at real
        estate, and a bunch of other things to make sure bills got paid.
        However, I have always drifted back to technology, so I decided to dive
        in. I started with a few classes in college, then attempted a boot camp,
        then I finally decided to go my own way. <i>Cue "Go Your Own Way" from
        Fleetwood Mac</i>.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I do a little bit of everything. I love reading,
        gaming, cooking, and taking a drive to random places just to see new
        things. I'm always looking for new ways to organize my life and things,
        and ways to be more efficient.</p>
        <h1>Coffee!</h1>
        <p>I am one of those freaks who drinks coffee all day long. I could
        probably make some terrible joke about not getting coffee in the morning,
        but haven't we all heard enough of those? But you should know that I
        am chock full of bad jokes. I've been around my husband too long...</p>
        <h1>Last But Not Least, Cats!</h1>
        <p>You know that person who has too much cat stuff in their house, always
        has cat fur on their clothes, and you suspect (but can't prove) that they
        have entirely too many cats of their own? That would be me. I am that person.
        </p>
